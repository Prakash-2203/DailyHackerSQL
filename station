// 1. Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.

SELECT CITY,STATE
FROM STATION;//

//2.Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE ID%2   =  0;//
// 3.Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

SELECT 
(SELECT COUNT(CITY)FROM STATION ) - 
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION ) AS difference;//


//4.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query


ANS:   
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1;

    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
    LIMIT 1
)
UNION
(
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
    LIMIT 1
);
